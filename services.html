                <p>Bio-remediation is the most important part of the process. This procedure not only sterilizes the home making it safe
                 and healthy but also eliminates pheromones, attractants and odors that draw the animals to your home.</p>

          <div class="animal-info">
            <h3>Rats</h3>
            <div class="animal-description">
              <p>Rats are typically indicated by noises being heard a night and scratching in the customer's attic. They leave small droppings,
              and dig longer tunnels in insulation. A rat problem is diagnosed by a large amount of droppings being found in the area in which
              they are living.</p>
            </div>
          </div>
          <div class="animal-info">
            <h3>Squirrels</h3>
            <div class="animal-description">
              <p>Squirrels are primarily heard throughout the day, most commonly at sunrise and sunset. They also leave small droppings,
               and leave trails and tunneling through insulation. It is common to find squirrels living within someone's attic without
               any droppings being present. Squirrels very rarely (if ever) enter a crawlspace beneath a home or office.</p>
            </div>
          </div>
          <div class="animal-info">
            <h3>Raccoons</h3>
            <div class="animal-description">
              <p>Raccoons are in most cases nocturnal. They leave large trails within the insulation, leave larger droppings, somewhat
              similar to a dog's, and in most cases leave some of damage to their entry point that can be easily viewed from outside. They
              often have 3-5 babies in the attic area which need to be manually extracted and transported to a licensed Wildlife Rehabilitator.</p>
            </div>
          </div>
          <div class="animal-info">
            <h3>Opossums</h3>
            <div class="animal-description">
              <p>Opossums are very similar to Raccoon in that they leave damage to exterior entry points and their droppings are of similar
              size. One differentiation is that opossums live in a low-lying area such as crawl-space, while raccoons are commonly
              found nesting in loftier areas.</p>
            </div>
          </div>
          <div class="animal-info">
            <h3>Snakes</h3>
            <div class="animal-description">
              <p>The vast majority of snakes we deal with are non-venomous, however care must be taken during the occasional encounter with
              a venomous snake. The most common indicator that someone has a snake problem after a visual encounter; however shed skin can also
              be an indicator. Certain species will often enter the attic or crawlspace of someone who is experiencing a rodent problem.</p>
            </div>
          </div>
          <div class="animal-info">
            <h3>Bats</h3>
            <div class="animal-description">
              <p>Bats are most notably characterized by the smell of their droppings (Guano). They fit in extremely tight spaces, and
              spend the day within this area. They leave the area soon after sunset to begin their nightly foraging. You will see
              Guano on the exterior of the building, usually at their entry point and in most cases our customer or a neighbor will
              have seen them exiting the building.</p>
            </div>
          </div>
          <div class="animal-info">
            <h3>Armadillos</h3>
            <div class="animal-description">
              <p>Armadillos are characterized by the holes they leave around a customer's yard. Large, "basketball" sized holes are generally
              used as a place of shelf while smaller, golf-ball to tennis sized holes will be noticed around the area where the armadillos
              search for food. These smaller holes are typically in area covered with mulch, or in dirt sand.</p>
